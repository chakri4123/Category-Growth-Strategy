# Category Growth Strategy Simulation

This project simulates an *e-commerce category growth analysis* with dummy sales data.  
It applies *data analytics + business insights* to optimize revenue, pricing, and promotions.

## ðŸ“Š Steps
1. Created synthetic dataset of 500 sales records across categories and regions.  
2. Performed *customer segmentation* and category-wise sales analysis.  
3. Simulated *pricing discount strategy (10%), which improved projected conversion by **12%*.  
4. Ran SQL queries on sales data to analyze category-region performance.  
5. Visualized insights with Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## ðŸš€ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Pandasql / SQLite
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
